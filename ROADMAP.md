# Project Roadmap

## Overview

This project is currently under active development. Both the underlying functionality and the game/analytical interface is not complete.
We are planning the following in short and long term.

## Short Term Goal

- **Complete Library**: The first priority is to complete the underlying implementation of the Prisoner's Dilemma Engine.


## Long Term Goal

- **Game TUI**: The next priority is to complete the _game-like_ interface of the TUI. This will allow for people to play against
the computer for a set of turns.
- **Analytical TUI**: This is a second TUI that allows you to simulate multiple different strategies and scores and analyze the results.

## Maintenance

- **Bug Fixes**: Bug fixing will be an ongoing process
- **Performance Improvements**: We will continue making advances to allow for the application to run at peak performance

## Community Involvement

- **Feedback and Suggestions**: Please [Create an Issue](https://github.com/AliSajid/dilemma-tactix/issues/new) if you have any suggestions
